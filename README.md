## Portfolio Site

<div align="center">
  <img src="Assets/HomePage.PNG" height="400" align="center" style="margin: 10"/>
</div>

This is a simple portfolio site I created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also learned how to use GitHub pages in order to publish it for others to see. It is my first attempt at a professional website, and I hope to update it as my skills improve!
